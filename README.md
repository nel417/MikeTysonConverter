# MikeTysonConverter
Simple Ruby app that converts a string to add a mike tyson lisp.

1.) Download file
2.) Open terminal / command prompt and cd to where your file is (cd location) my files get saved to my desktop so it would be cd desktop
3.) Run ruby miketyson.rb
4.) Type in a string of your choosing with an "s" in it.
5.) You will get back a string thats been mike tyson-ified. (if you type slippery slope you will get thlippery thlope)


thank you and enjoy!
